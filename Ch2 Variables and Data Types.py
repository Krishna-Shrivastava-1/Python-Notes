# Types of data types - 
# 1) String
# a = "krishna"
# print(a) 
# Example of String in [" "]

# 2) Integer
# b = 10
# print (b)
# Example of init in [10]

# 3) Floating Point Number
# c = 10.5
# print (c)
# Example of float in [10.5]

# 4) Boolean
# d1 = true
# d2 = false
# print (d1 d2)
# Example of boolean in [true OR false]

# 5) None
# e = None
# print (e)
# Example of Nan in [None]

# Variable name declaration Rules :-
# 1) Cannot define a varible from the number
# 2) You canot leave space in declaring variables

# Operators in Python
# 1) Assignent Operator = "-=" , "+=" , "=" etc.
# 2) Comparision Operator = "==" , ">" , ">=" , "<" , "!=" etc.
# 3) Logical Operator = "and" , "or" , "not" .
# 4) Arthmetic Operator = "+" , "-" , "/" , "*" etc.
# 5) Modulo Operator = "%" etc.

# Arthmetic Operator
# 7 + 4 = 11 [7 and 4 are operands], [+ is operator], [11 is result]
# a = 7
# b = 4
# c = a +b
# print(c)

# Assignent Operator
# a = 4-2 # Assigning 4-2 in a
# print (a)
# b = 6
# b += 3  # Increment b by +3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

# b -= 3  # Decrement b by -3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

# b *= 3  # Multiply b by 3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

# b /= 3  # Divide b by 3 and then assign it to b
# print(b)

#  Comparision Operator

# d = 5>4
# print(d)

# d = 5!= 8 # Means 5 is not equal to 8
# print(d)

# d = 5 == 5 [Double Equal to is to Check Both Numbers Are Equal Or Not]
# print (d)

#  Modulo Operator To Find Remainder in your division
# a = 5
# b = 34
# print(b % a)

# Logical Operator -:
# e = True or False # [and opertor return true when both condition are true
# But in or operator if any value is true then it return true and not check other value]
# print(e)

# Truth Table of [or]
# print("True or False is - ", True or False)
# print("True or True is - ", True or True)
# print("False or True is - ", False or True)
# print("False or False is - ", False or False)

# Truth Table of [and]
# print("True and False is - ", True and False)
# print("True and True is - ", True and True)
# print("False and True is - ", False and True)
# print("False and False is - ", False and False)

# Not
# print(not(True))
# print(not(False)) #not Operator operate on boolean and single operand and changes it from True to False Or False to True

# Type Functions & Type Casting

# b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
# print ("a is greater than b or not - ", (a+b)/2)

# a = int(input("Enter Your number: "))

# print ("Square of Your Number- ", a**2)  # [**] , means square of a {Not, Corret format is a^2 So avoid it}
